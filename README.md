# Overview

Prompt Bouncer is a tool that helps AI developers stop prompt-based attacks by providing a threat assessment of any incoming prompt. Prompt Bouncer acts like security personnel at the door of your AI system, checking every incoming prompt to ensure it is safe before allowing it through. It stops anything undesirable from getting in by looking for threats. Prompt Bouncer will create a recommendation on whether a prompt should be allowed through or not.
